Booklandia Library Management System is to facilitate efficient management of library resources, streamline borrowing and returning processes and enhance user experience through a user-friendly interface.

Motivated by a desire for deeper understanding of system development and PHP programming, this individual project aims to explore building a robust library management system. 

Individually developed 20+ functionalities, seamlessly integrating real-world entities, such as Book Operations, User Management and Restore.

ADMIN PANEL

The admin panel empowers administrators with intuitive interfaces to approve, reject, orhandle pending user sign-ups.
Administrators can efficiently
manage book operations,
including adding, editing, deleting,
borrowing, returning, fines, and
incorporating e-books. It
facilitates organizing books into
categories and implements data
export mechanisms, and provides
insightful dashboards for
monitoring library statistics.
